      <h3>24th August 2025 (Continued):</h3>
      <h4>Around 02:36 UTC </h4>
      <h5>Raja and Andre Discuss the Situation</h5>
      <p> Andre and Raja go to a different room together.</p>
      <p>Andre: "He's a fucking idiot, so when you run in on his shit, you fucking give him his receipt, you remember what a receipt is? Give him that fucking receipt bro, tag his shit. If they've got a fucking problem with it, I'll fucking run out there. Tag his shit dawg."</p>
      <p>Raja: "I'll get his ass. Ay, as long as I get my lick back I'm straight". Where's Rikishi?"</p>
      <p>Andre: "He'll be here a little later"</p>
      <p><a href="https://youtu.be/c8iP5IbpcEI" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[7]</a></p>
      <p><em>Raja is referring to JR. Rikishi Fatu, whose real name is Solofa Fatu Jr. He is a WWE Hall of Famer with a career that began in 1985. <a href="https://knokxpro.com/WebSite/trainers.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[20]</a> Rikishi is also a co-founder <a href="../../archive-sources/rikishi-twitter-founder.pdf" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[21]</a> and head trainer <a href="https://itrwrestling.com/news/wwe-and-rikishi-owned-knokx-pro-seemingly-done-after-raja-jackson-incident/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[22]</a> of KnokXPro.</a></em></p>
      <p><em>Raja and Andre walk back towards the entrance of the venue.</em></p>
      <p><em>Andre then speaks to security on the front of the venue and secures front row seats for Raja and his camera guy.</em></p>
      <h4>Around 02:38 UTC</h4>
      <h5>Raja and his cameraman are seated front row of the event.</h5>
      <p>Raja: That shit pissed me off and Imma have to get him back, they said I can go in the ring and get his ass, I don't even know what I'm gonna do to him though.</p>
      <p>Raja gets called over to the DJ booth to choose his entrance music, Raja walks over to the DJ and has a conversation with him, Raja then returns to his seat.</p>
      <p>Raja: "I'm beating this guys ass bro, i'm tryna see how long I get to stay in there for, I don't know how long I can stay in there for"</p>
      <p>Raja: (responding to a livestream comment) "I'm a fake crash out? Alright bet, bet, you about to see how fake of a crash out I am" </p>
      <p>Raja: "I get the chance to go in there, and now, really fuck him up, it's always been my dream to fuck up a pro wrestler for real, so I get it today".</p>
      <p>Raja: (responding to a livestream comment) "Am I really gonna fight him? Yeah, I'm gonna punch his ass for real."</p>
      <p>Raja: (responding to livestream comment) "How many subs to knock him out? That's a good question, I don't know, I ain't really sub farming but, 50 subs, knock him out, 50 subs. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iP5IbpcEI" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[7]</a></p>
      <p>Raja: "Yeah, they allowed me to hit him for real, if he hits me back for real, I don't give a fuck, I want him to. I'm dead serious chat, I'm really about to fuck him up. Imma show you how to take down a bigger guy. Chat W if you think I can pick him up, L if you think I can't." <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iP5IbpcEI" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[7]</a></p>
      <p>Raja: "Y'all want me to tea bag him?"</p>
      <p>Raja: (shouting) "Exactly, people think this shit's weak, people think this shit's a fucking game"</p>
      <p>Raja: "The nigga ain't no fighter, but Imma really have to show him, that you can't just hit a fucking can on my god damn face." </p>
      <p>Raja: "Imma hit him and imma take him down, I just don't know which one I should do first, I don't know whether I should take him down first, then hit him or hit him, then take him down"</p>
      <p>Raja: "That was a real fucking can, it just wasn't full, that was a real can of beer".</p>
      <p>Raja: "If I punch him and he goes down, then I won't be able to pick him up, what should I do chat, should I pick him up first, or hit him first? Should I slam him first, or hit him first?"</p>
      <p>Raja: "You know what, I just thought about it, Imma pick him up, Imma slam him, Imma let him get back up, then imma hit him, how bout that?"</p>
      <p>Raja: "It's not gonna be scripted when I get there, it's not gonna be scripted."</p>
      <p>Raja: (responding to a livestream comment) "I know all wrestling is scripted, i'm talking about what i'm gonna do to the guy"</p>
      <p><a href="https://youtu.be/c8iP5IbpcEI" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[7]</a></p>

      <h4>Around UTC 03:58</h4>
      <h5>Stuart (Syko Stu) Enters the Ring</h5>
      <p>Raja: "I will tell you guys this, they told me to hit him, and somebody will pull me off of him to leave, i'm telling you, i'm gonna hit him as many times as I can, watch.</p>
      <p>Raja: "And then as soon as i'm do what i'm doing, i'm leaving"</p>
      <p><a href="https://youtu.be/c8iP5IbpcEI" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[7]</a></p>

      <h4>Around 04:09 UTC</h4>
      <h5>Raja Enters the Ring and Assaults Stuart Smith (Syko Stu)</h5>
      <p><em>Raja slides under the botton rope of the ring entering the ring ("I don't like" by Chief Keef" starts playing through the speakers). Raja walks up behind Stuart (Syko Stu), then he double legs him, lifts him above his head and slams him on the mat rendering him unconcious, he then takes top mount, he then throws 12 strikes to his head, professional wrestler Elias Lopez (Doomsday) slides into the ring and attempts to restrain Raja by pulling his arm back. Raja then throws 9 more strikes towards his head, another wrestler called Douglas Malo (The Epic) throws Raja away from Stuart, Raja then attempts to double leg Douglas. The camera angle then drops, when the camera is lifted, Raja and Douglas are in a stalemate double overhook/double underhook position. Professional wrestler Joe Freeze (Freeze) pushes Raja and Douglas into the corner of the ring. Douglas then throws a headbutt in Raja's direction, then disengages from the clinch. Douglas appears to have a cut above his left eye. Raja is then escorted out of the building. Raja appears to have blood over the front of his t shirt. Raja then leaves the venue with his camera man. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iP5IbpcEI" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[7]</a></em></p>
      <p><em>Douglas Malo (The Epic) <a href="https://www.instagram.com/just_the_epic/?hl=en" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[23]</a> and Joe Freeze (Freeze) <a href="../../archive-sources/joe-freeze-instagram.jpg" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[24]</a> are regular professional wrestlers for KnokX Pro Entertainment & Academy. </em></p>
      
      <h4>Around 04:12 UTC</h4>
      <h5>Raja Outside of the Venue</h5>
      <p>Raja: "I'm tired of mother fuckers playing with me bruh, real shit. One of them little bitches fucking bit me. I'm tired of everybody playing with me and shit. Think i'm always playing and shit, calling me bitch and shit. I'm not a fucking bitch bruh. At the end of the day, I'm going to stand up for my fucking self. I'm tired of everyone fucking playing with me bruh, real shit.</p>
      <p>Joe Freeze then walks up to Raja. There are 2 other people in the background, it is uncertain, if they are associated.</p>
      <p>Joe Freeze: "Don't come over here, unless you want that viral moment, you feel me"</p>
      <p>Camera man: "Cmon man, Leave it man, we're walking away bro, let's go, cmon Raja, let's go, let's go Raja, let's go, Raja, let's go"</p>
      <p>Raja: "I don't give a fuck, you guys tried to jump me and shit, you ain't gonna do shit to me bro, you can't do shit to me, you can't fuck with me bro. You can't fuck with me.</p>
