      <p><em>A livestream commentor prompts Quinton to watch his son's (Raja Jackson's) live stream, Quinton then starts watching the stream on his phone. Quinton notices that Raja's microphone is disconnected and he has blood over his t-shirt and is "Raging Out". Sneako then arrives on the scene</em></p>
      <p>Quinton: "My son might be getting arrested, my son got into a fight at a pro wrestling event. He's safe though."</p>
      <p>Quinton: "There's a time to overparent and there's a time not to overparent" (Raja's stream ends)</p>
      <p>Quinton finds a clip of the incident on his phone and plays it, he looks perturbed and distraught and mouths "what the fuck man".</p>
      <p>Quinton: "Raja might go to jail, he might get banned off of Kick too."</p>
      <p>Quinton: "That was bad, I hope it was staged, I hope it's stage, because sometimes, some people do er hardcore pro wrestling, chat, chat, was that hardcore?</p>
      <p>Quinton: "I gotta call that guy AJ (Likely refering to Andre Hudson). Was it staged? Was it staged?" (Quinton then left the stream)</p>

      <h4>Quinton Jackson's posts a tweet commenting on the Raja Jackson & Stuart Smith incident.</h4>
      <p>Raja Jacksons's father and MMA superstar Quinton "Rampage" Jackson posted a tweet at 06:49 UTC addressing the Raja Jackson vs Stuart Smith incident. <strong>The text in bold in the following quote has our comments on the situation.</strong></p>
      <p>Quinton: "I want to clear up the misinformation about my son Raja. I’ve been confirmed that the wrestler ( Stewart <strong>"Stuart"</strong> Smith aka Syko Stu) is awake and stable. Raja was unexpectedly hit in the side of the head by him moments before Smith’s match <strong>"It was approximately 67 minutes and 50 seconds inbetween Raja getting hit on their head with a can and Stuart's ring entrance"</strong>, Raja was told that he could get his “payback”in the ring,i thought it was apart of the show. It was bad judgement, and a work that went wrong. Raja is a MMA fighter not a pro wrestler and had no business involved in an event like this. I don’t condone my son’s actions AT ALL! He suffered a concussion from sparring only days ago and had no business doing anything remotely close to physical contact. As a father, im deeply concerned with his health AND the well being of Mr. Smith. That being said I’m very upset that any of this happened,but my main concern now is that Mr. Smith will make a speedy recovery.I apologize on his behalf and to KICK for the situation."</p>

      <p>MMA Guru, a popular YouTube content creator (379K subscribers at the time of writing) who is best know for creating MMA videos and livestreams, posted a tweet at 07:51 UTC addressing the Raja Jackson vs Stuart Smith incident. </p>
      <p>MMA Guru: "Yeah fuck it he deserved the spinning kick in sparring Ive seen the whole situation & the Wrestler literally used a gimmick drink at Raja Jacksons head after saying "are you gonna sell it" This sneak response from him is attempted murder Dumb animal with no impulse control"</p>

      <h4>MMA Guru posts a video on Youtube responsing to the Raja Jackson & Stuart Smith situation.</h4>
      <p>MMA Guru, a YouTube content creator who is best know for creating MMA videos and livestreams, released a video at 15:34 UTC addressing the Raja Jackson vs Stuart Smith incident titled "Raja Jackson Attempts To Murder Pro Wrestler? Rampage Defends Him? HE BELONGS IN JAIL! My Reaction". <a href="https://youtu.be/l_qUMTn-KN8?si=pIm8OxLpookA3jA6" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>
      <div style="width:100%;">
        <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_qUMTn-KN8?si=tR8fiorXRB4R18Da" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen style="border-radius:12px;box-shadow:0 2px 12px rgba(13,71,161,0.10);"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p>The following are some key points from the video:</p>
      <p>MMA Guru argues that the can Stuart used to hit Raja with was a prop can.</p>
      <p>"This is an empty can of drink, empty, it is a gimmick fake can of nothing, absouletly nothing, it has no weight to it, it has no nothing, it is a wrestling prop... it may have much as much as a little bouncy ball bouncing off the side of head, there is no impact on that, he smashed a fake can of drink, full of vapor and air on Raja's head, it's a wrestling gimmick, it's like getting hit with a fake glass bottle."</p>
      <p>"Air comes out of it (the can), there's no liquid in that can, there's no weight to that can, it's a fake prop."</p>
      <p>Guru then sets out some hypothetical situations.</p>
      <p>"If Raja Jackson would've immidately hit this guy in the face and knocked him out, I would've said "self defence", he don't know that's a prop... "If he would've knocked the guy out right here, the second he got hit with that can, this video don't get made."</p>
      <p>"Dunks him unconcious on his head, if Raja Jackson gets back up right now, you could put this down to, he doesn't know what he's doing, this is why you don't have amateurs in a wrestling room doing stunts like this."</p>
      <p>"IShowSpeed (Social Media influencer) would fucking roll with it, becuase he's not a dumb animal that belongs in a cage, okay, ishowspeed would fucking roll with it and it wouldn't attempt to murder him later in that stream." </p>
      <p>MMA Guru notes that Stuart apologied and shakes hands with Raja.</p>
      <p>MMA Guru then argues that argues that failing to punish Raja would set a bad example for his alledged young audience.</p>
      <p>"He's a viral streamer to children, they cannot see this, and see Raja Jackson not in a cage, for the next few decades afterwards, you need to set a standard in society."</p>
      <p>He also responds to Quinton “Rampage” Jackson's tweet, saying Rampage's claim that there was misinformation around the incident was false and that this response made him particularly angry.</p>
      <p>MMA Guru dismisses any suggestion that Raja's actions could be explained by a sparring concussion:</p>
      <p>"People are using (that) as an excuse, he got barely wobbled by a 50% spinning kick, he did not get flatline ko'd into a coma and now he doesn't know what's going on. Shut up, that is not an excuse for him at all."</p>
      <p>MMA Guru states/infers that Raja is a "dumb animal around 28 times in the 41 minutes and 58 second video. As well as insulting Raja in various other ways.</p>
      <p>"End of discussion, you are a dumb animal that does not belong in society, you have forfeited that right, because you have proven yourself as an unevolved human, go sit in a cage for 30 - 40 years, where you fucking belong, you dumb animal."</p>
      <p>"This is a dumb animal with no frontal cortex"</p>

      <h4>WWE cuts ties with KnokX Pro Entertainment & Academy?</h4>
      <p>"WWE Independent Development™ (WWE ID) is designed to provide independent wrestlers a clear pathway to a potential career in WWE." <a href="https://recruit.wwe.com/wwe-id" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>
      <p>KnokX Pro Entertainment & Academy became an affiliate of the WWE ID program on the 29th October 2024. <a href="../../archive-sources/knokxpro-signs-with-wweid-facebook-post.pdf" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>
      <p>Using the wayback machine <a href="https://web.archive.org/" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a>, an online web archiving tool, we compared the WWE ID affiliate section of the WWE website snapshots of 02/04/2025 <a href="../../archive-sources/WWE-ID-April-02-2025.html" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a> and 26/05/2025 <a href="../../archive-sources/WWE-ID-August-26-2025.html" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a>. The difference being that the snapshot on 2nd April 2025 listed KnokXPro Entertainment & Academy as an affiliate, while the snapshot on 26th August 2025 did not.</p>
      <p>Available evidence suggests that the elimination of the affiliation was not between from April 2nd 2025 and August 20th 2025 as the official KnokX Pro Entertainment & Academy Instagram was using WWE ID branding in their promotional work on the 21st August 2025. <a href="../../archive-sources/knokxpro-wwe-id-branding-august-21-2025.jpg" target="_blank" class="source-ref">[x]</a></p>

      </div>
      <p>The following are some key points from the video.</p>

      <h5>Douglas and Ian detail updates on Stuart Smith's injuries.</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "Broken facial bones... missing teeth, has no recollection of what happened, incoherent."</p>
      <p>Douglas: "He was given CPR. He was choking on his fucking blood."</p>
      <p>Douglas: "He was a load and go criteria (when a patient is so critical they must be taken to hospital immediately, with only minimal care given on scene)."</p> 
      <p>Douglas: "He was induced (into a coma)."</p>
      <p>Ian "The Captain" Morgan: He had brain swelling as of last night. It's gone down since then and reports as of late have said that he's up and alive, but... is having trouble walking, maintaining his balance... they just took him off a breathing tube this morning."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lq0DHvWw8c&t=1s" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>

      <h5>Douglas claims that he was told to be put on standby if any incidents occur with Raja</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "Then I get a whisper by somebody... I might need you to go out there and check a scenario. This guy's (Raja's) going to do a spot. They told me that they made up, shook hands, hugged it out multiple times. So it was going to be fine, but they just want to make sure."</p>
      <p>Douglas: "Hey,can you go out there and make sure nothing bad happens? So now I got all this responsibility."</p>
      <p>Erik: "It seems like they kind of wanted you there just because you're the only one who can shoot, which in wrestling means for real fight, right?"</p>
      <p>Douglas: "Like how you would use a dog like, hey, we'll send our bitch to go do this."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lq0DHvWw8c&t=1s" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>

      <h5>Douglas accuses Andre Hudson (AJ Mana) of manipulating Raja into assaulting Stuart</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "I think the pre-meditation part comes on the side of AJ Mana (Andre Hudson). You brought somebody that was volatile (Raja) that you knew had issues. That's the small calf, small ass chicken legs bitch with the cowboy hat."</p>
      <p>Douglas: "I don't like Raja. I think Raja is a shit person for what he did. But I think AJ is a bigger shit person for gassing him up to be in that fucking ring, to leading him to ruin his own life, to hurt somebody that AJ (Andre Hundson) also has a problem with... You got somebody that's a real fighter (Raja) trained by somebody that was one of the greatest of all time (Raja's father Quinton "Rampage" Jackson) And then you had him do your dirty work."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lq0DHvWw8c&t=1s" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>

      <h5>Douglas then provides his account on the incident.</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "I see the slam. I see the first punch, second punch...and I just start moving (towards the ring)."</p>
      <p>Douglas: "And then when we're in the ring and I'm breaking it up and he shoots a double leg on me, by the way, work a better double leg. You prick. And then I'm telling you to calm down. I'm not even fucking fighting. I'm not even being fucking hostile. Then you're trying to fucking work and get lower. Do this, change positions, and I'm only having to swim with you all this other shit. And then you fucking punch me in the fucking eye after we're breaking it up. You fucking loser. That's why you got fucking headbutt. And that's why I fucking punched you and you're fucking lucky I was tired from the match before this."</p>
      <p>Douglas: "And by the way, Raja, that was me who bit you asshole. I'd do it again too, but this time I'm gonna get your nose."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lq0DHvWw8c&t=1s" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>

      <h5>Douglas highlights that there were children and families at the event.</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "There was kids crying. There was women and children upset... It's fucked up. You know, like, you have kids at the show, you have families of the show. We're supposed to be here for a good time."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lq0DHvWw8c&t=1s" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>
      
      <h5>Douglas claims that the police arrived 15 minutes after Raja left the venue.</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "There were multiple (police) reports. I talked to the cops... (They showed up) 15 minutes after that little bitch fled."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lq0DHvWw8c&t=1s" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>

      <h5>Ian claims that KnokX Pro Entertainment & Academy encouraged some of their employees not to cooperate with the police.</h5>
      <p>Ian: "The most disgusting thing is that people at this school are being encouraged to not cooperate with the police. From that I hear the police were there investigating the scene shortly after Stu was removed. And there has been multiple requests that have gone downstream from upper management to not talk with the police directly if they are contacted and to only let a certain group of individuals interact with the police. That is extremely dishonest."</p>
      <p>Ian: "They encouraged every single member of this academy to stay quiet and not contact the authorities, not respond to the authorities. While simultaneously being extremely excited that this event has landed them 15 minutes of fame, they were encouraging people to repost their brother getting beaten to death and discouraging them from talking to law enforcement."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lq0DHvWw8c&t=1s" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>
      
      <h5>Douglas confirms his depature from KnokXpro Entertainment & Academy.</h5>
      <p>Erik: "So Doug, are you still a part of KnokxPro?"</p>
      <p>Douglas: "No, what's the point? They would watch me die."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lq0DHvWw8c&t=1s" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>

      <h5>Douglas defend Rishiki and RIshiki's son Tamiko</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "Rikishi gets the fucking blame because his name is on the school, but that doesn't represent him. It doesn't represent Tamiko. Doesn't represent a lot of people there."</p>
      <p>Erik: "Or Rikishi wasn't even aware of it, right?" </p>
      <p>Ian: "No, he wasn't even in town. He was out of state."</p>
      <p>Douglas: "Honestly, he's (Rikishi's) a beautiful person. I love him. I love his son Tamiko."</p>

      <p>Saul: "After Saturday's incident, I have chosen to disassociate myself from Knokxpro. I cannot continue to be part of a group that is careless and not willing to take accountability for their role in the incident. The organization has shown that they care more about clout than their students and workers. They have proven that our values are very different and I can no longer be part of that organization. This is not the end for me, it's only the beginning. I will continue to train and wrestle until I can make a name for myself in the industry." <a href="../../archive-sources/saul-luna-knokx-depature-instagram.jpg" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>

I’d like to say thank you all for the opportunity. Without KnokX pro wrestling I would’ve never met some of my best friends in this industry. Thank you Rikishi for taking a chance on me and working on The Rundown show. I will forever be grateful to you. Please know that no one blames you for any of this. This is not your fault. I love you Uso. I hope we can work together again down the line. But for now after careful consideration we as a collective have decided it’s best if we step away. Wherever you see us next it’s going to be BIG. This is The Boys signing off.

Every single one of you is beyond talented and I hope that for the sake of wrestling, your journeys do not end here, in mine and other people's eyes you all are beyond talented and deserve to move forward with this dream. There are far too many people to even tag or name but you all know who you are and I know we will most certainly cross paths soon. Last but most certainly".</p>

      <h5>Douglas states that he's confident Raja will be Arrested</h5>
      <p>Erik: "Will Raja Jackson be arrested from what you're hearing?"</p>
      <p>Douglas: "Yeah, there's not a doubt in my mind. Everything's on tape, on video. It's premeditated. Just LAPD tends to drag their feet."</p>
      <h5>Douglas claims he's that he (Douglas) is likely not going to face any legal repercussions.</h5>
      <p>Douglas: ""I even asked about my implications... you know, you're (referring to himself) involved and whatnot. And he (the detective) goes, no, there's nothing to worry about. He asked a couple other questions about the other videos involved with the people in the back and this and that."</p>
      <h5>Douglas highlights that there was a lot of Witnesses at the Incident</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "Because there's so many people, so many witnesses. Heck, even my little brother saw it. My girlfriend, my mom, all the kids that saw it, all the people there, so that right there, they have the evidence enough to try the case."</p>
      <h5>Douglas implies that he would not (hypothetically) be bribed to change his opinion</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "I just would never change my opinion for money. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. I don't know if you guys, you wanna see my bank account and how broke I am right now?</p>
      <h5>Douglas claims that there are lawyers involved in the on behalf of Stuart Smith.</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "I know from a decent source that there are lawyers involved (on behalf of Stuart)"</p>
      <h5>Douglas praises professional wrestler Elias Lopez for his Intervention</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "Elias (Elias Lopez), the young 17 (18) year old who was the first one to make contact with Raja is 17... He's a brave young man who had the balls to do something he was absolutely terrified of, but still went and did it anyways and he tried... You know, at that age, he did the best that he could and I'm glad that nothing bad happened to him."</p>

      <h4>The "Scaling Up Podcast" interviews Elias Lopez "Doomsday"</h4>
      <p>Professional Wrestler Elias Lopez "Doomsday" makes an appearance on the "Scaling Up Podcast" on a platform called Youtube. The hosts of this podcast are Eric Kanevsky and Tanner (Unknown Last Name). The video is 31 minutes and 57 seconds long.</p>
      <div style="width:100%;">
        <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VemPzZ3qPf0?si=YwM1dmFe3VlXU69-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen style="border-radius:12px;box-shadow:0 2px 12px rgba(13,71,161,0.10);"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p>Here are some key moments from the interview:</p>
      <p>Elias claims that he was only told about Raja's involvement during match 1, when his match was match 4. That every wrestler in the match was against the idea of Raja being in the match. That Raja was only supposed to come up to his manager, distract the ref and give Stu a single punch in the face.</p>
      <p>Erik questions Elias on Timmy pinning Stuart after the assault on Stuart had concluded. Elias states that Timmy was trying to "snap the ref back the reality" and that he shielded Stuart's body as well as rolling him to the side of the ring to prevent Stuart from choking on his own blood. Elias states that he was struggling to restrain Raja as he had injured his arm earlier in the professional wrestling match.</p>
      <p>Elias retells a story on of 2 seperate training incidents with KnokXPro Entertainment & Academy, when he was 16 years old. The first of which he got a minor concussion after failing a bump (a fall) from a clothes line (professional wrestling move). The doctor told him to take take 1-2 weeks rest, upon his return to training, he hit his head again after being DDT'd (professional wrestling move) which caused him to have a brain bleed and 2 seizures. During this discussion, Erik (former professional wrestler at KnoksXPro Entertainment & Academy) and Elias both agreed that the ring is too hard and that they should've replaced it a long time ago, Erik states that it is the same ring as they had 11 years ago. Elias states the mentality is that "if you can do it on this mat, you can do it anywhere". Erik confirms this sentiment by stating he was told by an old school wrestler there that said they used to train on concrete.</p>
      <p>Erik then retells a story of an incident that happened in a practice match at KnokXPro Entertainment & Academy, he states he wasn't taught a technique to mitigate damage when someone jumps on you, someone jumped on him with their knees into his spleen, his injury was a ruptured spleen causing internal bleeding, he almost died because of this. He recalls that his mum told the trainers about his near death experience and coach says that Erik needs to work on his selling (making hits seem believable). Erik states he was told by doctors to avoid wrestling training for 1 year, 4 months into his recovery, he heard news that a wrestler died at KnokXPro Entertainment & Academy but doesn't have any details of the death, the death may not have been wrestling related. Erik states that during this wrestlers funeral, some of the trainers were taking selfies smiling whilst holding his casket and posting them and shortly after posted videos moving of general professional wrestling promotion. After seeing this, Erik left the organisation.</p>
      <p>Erik: "Both of our situations could've been prevented with better training."</p>
      <p>Elias claims that he has spoken to Stuart and his family wouldn't divuldge any further information for privacy reasons.</p>
