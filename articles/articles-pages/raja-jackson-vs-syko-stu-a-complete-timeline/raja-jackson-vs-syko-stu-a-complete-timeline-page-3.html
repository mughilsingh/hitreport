      <h4>Quinton Jackson's posts a tweet commenting on the Raja Jackson & Stuart Smith incident.</h4>
      <h5>Overview</h5>
      <p>At 06:49 UTC Raja Jacksons's father and MMA superstar Quinton "Rampage" Jackson posted a tweet addressing the Raja Jackson vs Stuart Smith incident. <strong>The text in bold in the following quote has our comments on the situation.</strong></p>
      <h5>Quinton Jackson's Tweet</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-purple">
        <p><span class="speaker">Quinton:</span> "I want to clear up the misinformation about my son Raja. I’ve been confirmed that the wrestler ( Stewart <strong>"Stuart"</strong> Smith aka Syko Stu) is awake and stable. Raja was unexpectedly hit in the side of the head by him moments before Smith’s match <strong>(It was approximately 67 minutes and 50 seconds inbetween Raja getting hit on their head with a can and Stuart's ring entrance)</strong>, Raja was told that he could get his “payback”in the ring,i thought it was apart of the show. It was bad judgement, and a work that went wrong. Raja is a MMA fighter not a pro wrestler and had no business involved in an event like this. I don’t condone my son’s actions AT ALL! He suffered a concussion from sparring only days ago and had no business doing anything remotely close to physical contact. As a father, im deeply concerned with his health AND the well being of Mr. Smith. That being said I’m very upset that any of this happened,but my main concern now is that Mr. Smith will make a speedy recovery.I apologize on his behalf and to KICK for the situation."</p>

      <h5>Overview</h5>
      <p>At 15:34 UTC MMA Guru, a YouTube content creator who is best know for creating MMA videos and livestreams, released a video addressing the Raja Jackson vs Stuart Smith incident titled "Raja Jackson Attempts To Murder Pro Wrestler? Rampage Defends Him? HE BELONGS IN JAIL! My Reaction". <a href="https://youtu.be/l_qUMTn-KN8?si=pIm8OxLpookA3jA6" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>

      </div>
      <p>The following are some key points from the video:</p>
      <h5>MMA Guru Argues that the Can Stuart used to hit Raja with was a Prop Can.</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">MMA Guru:</span> "This is an empty can of drink, empty, it is a gimmick fake can of nothing, absouletly nothing, it has no weight to it, it has no nothing, it is a wrestling prop... it may have as much as a little bouncy ball bouncing off the side of head, there is no impact on that, he smashed a fake can of drink, full of vapor and air on Raja's head, it's a wrestling gimmick, it's like getting hit with a fake glass bottle."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">MMA Guru:</span> "Air comes out of it (the can), there's no liquid in that can, there's no weight to that can, it's a fake prop."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>MMA Guru then Sets out some Hypothetical Situations.</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">MMA Guru:</span> "If Raja Jackson would've immidately hit this guy in the face and knocked him out, I would've said "self defence", he don't know that's a prop... "If he would've knocked the guy out right here, the second he got hit with that can, this video don't get made."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">MMA Guru:</span> "Dunks him unconcious on his head, if Raja Jackson gets back up right now, you could put this down to, he doesn't know what he's doing, this is why you don't have amateurs in a wrestling room doing stunts like this."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">MMA Guru:</span> "IShowSpeed (Social Media influencer) would fucking roll with it, becuase he's not a dumb animal that belongs in a cage, okay, ishowspeed would fucking roll with it and it wouldn't attempt to murder him later in that stream." </p>
      </div>
      <h5>MMA Guru Argues that argues that failing to punish Raja would set a bad example for his alledged young audience.</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">MMA Guru:</span> "He's a viral streamer to children, they cannot see this, and see Raja Jackson not in a cage, for the next few decades afterwards, you need to set a standard in society."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>MMA Guru dismisses any suggestion that Raja's actions could be explained by a sparring concussion:</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">MMA Guru:</span> "People are using (that) as an excuse, he got barely wobbled by a 50% spinning kick, he did not get flatline ko'd into a coma and now he doesn't know what's going on. Shut up, that is not an excuse for him at all."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>MMA Guru states/infers that Raja is a "dumb animal around 28 times in the 41 minutes and 58 second video. As well as insulting Raja in various other ways.</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">MMA Guru:</span> "End of discussion, you are a dumb animal that does not belong in society, you have forfeited that right, because you have proven yourself as an unevolved human, go sit in a cage for 30 - 40 years, where you fucking belong, you dumb animal."</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">MMA Guru:</span> "This is a dumb animal with no frontal cortex"</p>

      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">MMA Guru:</span> "25 year old grown ass man rage baited into attempted murder because he needs to make sure that the 12 year olds in his chat don't think he's a bitch. Well done Raja Jackson you're the biggest bitch of 2025. Toxic masculinity is a lack of it. Dumb animal, its 2025.

      <h5>Charlie gives a brief overview of the situation</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">Charles:</span> "It is incomprehensible that yet another potential death was just streamed on kick. I'm recording this an hour after it happened and the victim is currently still in the ICU so I guess by the time I post this I'll know whether or not they passed away but I'm going to keep this part in here right now because it's up in the air."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">Charles:</span> "A kick streamer, Raja Jackson, who is the son of Rampage Jackson and also a professional fighter, just went fucking ballistic on a wrestler during a wrestling event on stream. He picks the wrestler up, slams him on the mat and then lays down 27 punches to the man's skull, most of which were delivered while he was unconscious and by the end of it he is bleeding and bloodied. They couldn't wake him up. They said he was barely breathing and someone even used the word flatline that he was flatlined in the ring. "</p>
      </div>
      <h5>Penguinz0 Futher Highlights the Severity of Potential Injuries</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">Charles:</span> "It's not like he's pulling any of his punches. They are all hitting squarely on this man's skull, bouncing his head off of the mat and I said most of them were when he was unconscious.
        </p></div>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">Charles:</span> "That can be fatal. That is most often times fatal, and he wasn't done either. It's not like he just stopped and said okay well that's plenty. I've had my fill. He was still going. The only reason there weren't more punches thrown by him  is because the other wrestlers were able to separate him but he was fighting against them to go back and keep beating this unconscious man. He probably wouldn't have stopped punching him until his head popped like a balloon. It's extremely scary and even if he does pull through, this could have life-changing repercussions with brain damage and so many other complications." </p>
      </div>
      <h5>Charles On The Can</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">Charles:</span> "When it comes to wrestling there's a little something called kayfabe and so they are going to portray their character to the best of their ability and keep everything as authentic and genuine as possible and Syko Stu was in character and misunderstood that Raja Jackson was not a worker in the event."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">Charles:</span> "And  (Stuart) he takes it way too far when he takes a beer can I don't know if it's like a real beer can or like one of those breakaway like stunt ones but he takes it and he crushes it on Raja Jackson's head then you can see him get really fired up about it and all the other wrestlers are also saying to Syko Stu, like bro what the fuck are you doing he's not like a worker here or anything that was too far and that's what started this."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">Charles:</span> "I think if Raja Jackson had swung on Syko Stu after the beer can thing you could definitely make a strong case that he was acting in self-defense, because that is unexpected, it was unprovoked and it was kind of a crazy thing for Syko Stu to do, not knowing for sure if Raja Jackson was a worker in the event or not, it was a bad judgment call for sure from Stu, and he was just like way too fucking committed to being the heel, like he was really deep into his method acting,, like fucking Shia LaBeouf style, and he did the beer can thing, and it was definitely over the line."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">Charles:</span> "Yes he made a mistake with rampage Jackson's son here not knowing whether or not he was a worker and still building the storyline anyway under the impression he was but it's not a mistake that should have led to something like this especially when he did everything in his power to try and rectify it and try and apologize for his mistake He was just acting Raja Jackson was flexing his thespian skills here when he was pretending that everything was okay between those two because what he was actually doing was plotting a premeditated assault on psycho stew "</p>
      </div>
      <h5>Charles Highlights that Stuart was Apologetic</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">Charles:</span> "Here's something a lot of people aren't showing enough of that Syko Stu was very apologetic when he learned that Raja Jackson was not a worker at the event he apologized three times they shook hands multiple times and Raja said like hey it's good I get it multiple times meanwhile he was just like bubbling with anger waiting for his chance to fucking assault this man you know."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>Charles on the Self Defense Arguement</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
        <p><span class="speaker">Charles:</span> "That potential argument of self-defense that has poofed away like timmy turner's fairy god parents that ship sailed a long time ago because he didn't act in response to the threat like after the beer can was crushed on his head which again he wasn't expecting and that can be dangerous but he didn't like act in the heat of the moment to defend himself from that or anything instead he let it marinate let his rage bubble up and then waited for his opportunity to get revenge later"</p>
      </div>  
      <h5>Charles suspects/claims that Raja has no Empathy</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
          <p><span class="speaker">Charles:</span> "This guy does not seem to care at all this is a fucking monster right here in response to hearing that the guy flatlined he just says my bad, "that's crazy", Kratos had more empathy for the people that he killed in very similar fashion by the way with like the unbelievable amount of blows to the head but at least in Kratos case the people he was fighting they were at least conscious all of these were delivered to an unconscious man, a man who never even saw this coming by the way because he storms into the ring grabs him and then slams him so it wasn't even a fight but he walks away feeling so fucking tough and accomplished about it with no remorse at all for potentially killing this man."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-block quote-green">
          <p><span class="speaker">Charles:</span> "He's (Raja's) walking away from this with his chin held high extremely proud of what's unfolded here it seems like this might be the happiest moment of his life the way that he is perceiving this is him standing up for himself he is not able to have a grasp on the severity of what just happened here he thinks that because the disrespect that he encountered early in the day bhe was entirely justified to potentially murder this man."</p>

If someone goes on steroids and they beat the fuck out of somebody, that's no different to me than somebody going and getting drunk and then running somebody over in a car.

      </div>
      <h5>Chael Provides a Positive Character reference of Raja Jackson</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">Chael:</span>"I know this young man and I like him a lot. I don't just know him to be level-headed and calm, I know him to be quite polite."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>Chael Highlights what Parts of the Assault he Believes was Scripted</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">Chael:</span>"You saw Raja get in the ring as part of a wrestling angle that was scripted and planned. You see Raja come in with his wits about him, waits for the right moment, picks up a double leg, just as it was planned, and he's doing this with Syko Stu and Syko Stu is letting it play perfectly. Raja then turns him around so that when he brings him down, it's right in the center of the ring, which appears to be very clearly what they agreed and had planned to do. Now the landing is not great. When Raja brings Syko Stu down, it's not great and Stu lands in a way and he hits the back of his head and he looks as though he perhaps lost a level of consciousness right...  from my vantage point is working out (acting) the spot the way it was planned."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>Chael believes, the First 2 Strikes were not from Anger</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">Chael:</span>"Raja then follows up with a right hand, then he switches and follows up with a left hand. Now these were hard shots, however, and again I'm giving you my perception... While they were very stiff shots, not what we would call a working shot, it did not appear that Raja had lost his temper. It did not appear that these were being done out of anger."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">Chael:</span>"At this point (after the first 2 strikes) it appears that Raja marked out for his own gimmick and really begins laying some shots in, but those shots are done out of anger."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>Chael Alludes that a Juror would not be able to Differentiate between the "fake" and "real" strikes.</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">Chael:</span>"You're going to have no ability to get into the eye or mind of the DA or a potential juror. You're going to have no ability to do that. If you don't understand emotion versus action, right? The action is supposed to look like he's punching him. The action is supposed to look like he turns him into 180 and slams him down on the back of his head. So then where you cross that already blurred line, right, which professional wrestling is already the blurred line."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>Chael Alludes that it's Normal for a "Real" Strike to Occur in Professional Wrestling</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">Chael:</span>"And sometimes some shots get through. One of the most famous ones that you guys would have seen was, was Braun Strowman. Brock Lesnar trusted Braun. Braun did a move that was too hard. Brock responded with a real life punch that settled Strowman back down... These are very normal things that happen in the business."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>Chael Claims it is Common Practice for Professional Wrestlers to tell Non Professional's actually Hit Them</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">Chael:</span>"Now, a number of people that will come into pro wrestling that don't know pro wrestling, the wrestler will actually tell them, just hit me. Big show did this with Floyd Mayweather builds this thing up and it's going to be a WrestleMania and Floyd had no wrestling practice and big show should just let it go. I can take the shot and the only way we're going to sell this and make this look real for the audience is if it is real. And a number of wrestlers have told a number of non wrestlers, this very thing."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>Chael Alludes that the Police may not have Arrested Raja yet, due to fear of Embarrassment.</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">Chael:</span>"But you have a police department that is in possession of this information and has not done an arrest. Why? Well. If Stu comes out and says this was all part of the spot (says the assault was apart of the show). If he just says those words, no matter how much you're reworking reality in history, if he says those words, the police then look like fools. "</p>
      </div>
      <h5>Chael Alludes that if Stuart Breaks "Kayfabe" it would Ruin his Professional Wrestling Career</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">Chael:</span>"So the police are in possession of a video which is highly against the law. Unless, Stu comes out as a performer, and says this was agreed upon... Is he going to come out and say that? Or is he going to stick to kayfabe and stick to the character and say, no, the whole the whole script was I let him spin me and when I come down, I act like I'm unconscious. All we did is follow the script, and Stu hasn't spoke yet. If Stu was to come out. It would effectively, end his time in professional wrestling."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">Chael:</span>"Back in the territory days, there was a number of bookers that would tell the boys, you know... everybody's got a camera now... you got it right on your phone, but it didn't used to be that way back then. And these guys would go out to the taverns and the promoter and booker would tell them openly. You can go out and you can go to the local bars. If any of you get beat up in a fight at a local bar, you're fired. If any of you break the character that you're not real bad asses, even to a bar full of 30 or less people, that's 30 or less people that I don't need to know that you're not actual bad asses. Go ahead and go out, lose a fight, you're fired."</p>
      </div>   
       <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">Chael:</span>"Stu, who is dedicated and has spent some time and he's out there on this, this indie scene, is he willing to take a match and light a fire to his career?"</p>
      </div>
      <h5>Chael claims that Stuart would not recieve "Millions" in lawsuit money if he goes up against Raja Jackson</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">Chael:</span>"It's not as though you can sue Raja and end up with millions of dollars. You could go you could go sue him and get a judgment. The guy doesn't have the money. You're not going to get the money."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>Chael shares how this Situation could be Turned to a Opportunity</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">Chael:</span>"You will truly have a kayfabe moment where these guys could build. These are indie scene guys. This isn't getting picked up by Triple H. But on the indie scene, you now have the makings of a good angle. And, an angle in exchange for your reputation, even if it's make believe. Is it trade that most guys would take."</p>

The portions featuring Raja can be verified against his original broadcast; however, the segments depicting Rampage cannot currently be cross-checked, as no official VOD or archived recording of his stream from that timeframe is publicly available. It is known that Rampage later appeared live with popular creator Sneako, though that broadcast began after the alleged phone call and does not contain it.</p>

      <p>"WWE Independent Development™ (WWE ID) is designed to provide independent wrestlers a clear pathway to a potential career in WWE." <a href="https://recruit.wwe.com/wwe-id" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>
      <p>KnokX Pro Entertainment & Academy became an affiliate of the WWE ID program on the 29th October 2024. <a href="../../archive-sources/knokxpro-signs-with-wweid-facebook-post.pdf" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>
      <p>Using the wayback machine <a href="https://web.archive.org/" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a>, an online web archiving tool, we compared the WWE ID affiliate section of the WWE website snapshots of 02/04/2025 <a href="../../archive-sources/WWE-ID-April-02-2025.html" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a> and 26/05/2025 <a href="../../archive-sources/WWE-ID-August-26-2025.html" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a>. The difference being that the snapshot on 2nd April 2025 listed KnokXPro Entertainment & Academy as an affiliate, while the snapshot on 26th August 2025 did not.</p>
      <p>Available evidence suggests that the elimination of the affiliation was not between from April 2nd 2025 and August 20th 2025 as the official KnokX Pro Entertainment & Academy Instagram was using WWE ID branding in their promotional work on the 21st August 2025. <a href="../../archive-sources/knokxpro-wwe-id-branding-august-21-2025.jpg" target="_blank" class="source-ref">[x]</a></p>

You got somebody that's a real fighter (Raja) trained by somebody that was one of the greatest of all time (Raja's father Quinton "Rampage" Jackson) And then you had him do your dirty work."</p>

Do this, change positions, and I'm only having to swim with you all this other shit. And then you fucking punch me in the fucking eye after we're breaking it up. You fucking loser.

      </div>
      <h5>On Raja Jackson's actions</h5>
      <p>MMA Guru: I can't watch someone try and kill someone, and the only reason they didn't kill him, is because someone had to pull them off of them.</p>
      <h5>On "Dumb Animal" Remarks</h5>
      <p>MMA Guru: "I didn't make it about race at all in that video. I even said yeah, IShowSpeed (a popular African American celebrity) wouldn't have done this because IShowSpeed's not a dumb animal. I called  Raja Jackson a dumb animal, because he is, I saw his animalistic instincts, that's not human, you see an unconscious body, in front of you that has really done nothing to you whatsoever and you keep going until they until someone pulls you off, or they die, you're an animal...there's nothing wrong with me saying that, at all."</p>
      <p>MMA Guru: "That's why I said dumb animal over and over again in my response video, because I wanted to make a point. I'm going to call him this (dumb animal), and you ain't going to tell me shit not to, at all. I'm going to call an attempted murderer what I fucking want to call him."</p>
      <h5>On Quinton "Rampage Jackson"</h5>
      <p>MMA Guru: "You guys may have thought for a second that in this situation where Raja Jackson attempted to murder Syko Stu and you all saw it on video you guys may have thought for a second that Raja Jackson was the bad guy in this situation. But you were wrong! You were actually wrong! You're incorrect to assume that. I am the bad guy in this situation, because I called Raja Jackson names. Yes, that's right. I called Raja Jackson some mean offensive names because he attempted to murder someone over basically nothing. And now I'm the bad guy."</p>
      <p>MMA Guru: "Right now, his father Rampage Jackson, is dating whores on stream and bowling with them, while reading dono (donation) messages about the entire situation."</p>
      <p>MMA Guru: "I love rampage Jackson man I hate this... real ones of my channel know how big of a fan I am of Rampage Jackson man you know how much this hurts to do, when I get into this scene. and then all my favourites, start poking at me, and I'm like, I'm gonna have to fucking, I'm gonna have to slander him."</p>
      <p>MMA Guru: "It's 2025, come on Guru we don't call people names (Mocking Quinton). Your son just attempted to murder someone on camera, over nothing, over nothing, it's 2025. I mean, come on you guys, it's 2025, it's 2025, exactly (Again Mocking Quinton), tell your son to stop randomly trying to murder people over fucking nothing, okay, but now I'm the problem."</p>
      <p>MMA Guru: "You were cool with me, right until this moment, even though, I've probably done worse shit before in the past, this is my least controversial shit... but it's because it applies to rampage, now there's a problem with it...I should have brought up clips of rampage shouting me out on his stream, asking to do a collab. Oh my God find me a clip of Rampage asking for a collab on his stream, he's done it like five times. You were all aboard for the Jon Jones shit, remember that."</p>
      <p>MMA Guru: "Wouldn't it be a really crazy situation guys, if Rampage Jackson, if there was like..., decently good evidence that Rampage Jackson had done exactly what Raja Jackson did to someone else, except outside of a gym... wouldn't it be crazy if Rampage just for over nothing assaulted some random regional MMA fighter and put him into the concrete outside of a gym with follow up shots, wouldn't that be insane, Rampage? Maybe I'll read a name for you, it ends in Court."</p>
      <h5>On the MMA coummunity and Industry</h5>
      <p>MMA Guru: "I could have made it into this MMA community, into this tight-knit MMA inside circle, that I've been clearly blacklisted from. (Be)cause Chael's (Chael Sonnen's) in it and we saw Chael's response to the rampage Jackson thing... Brendan Schuab given a better take than anyone and that's fucking insane, you guys are letting Brendan Schuabe outtake you, okay, that's the level we're at in society. Josh Thompson and John McCarthy had a fucking bigger problem with the referee than Rampage Jackson's son's behavior."</p>

      <p>"Stuart has been released from the hospital and is now home resting. He sustained a serious head injury and was unconscious upon arrival at the ER. His injuries include trauma to both the upper and lower jaws, a laceration to his upper lip, and a fracture to the maxilla bone, which unfortunately resulted in the loss of several teeth. He has a long road of recovery ahead, but he remains in good spirits despite everything he has been through. We are deeply grateful for all the love and support we’ve received during this time. Thank you to everyone who has contributed in any way—whether through monetary donations, food, flowers, or gifts. Your kindness means more than words can express. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. With love and respect, Contessa Patterson & Stuart Smith (aka SykoStu)"</p>

      <h4>Harvard Lawyer & Pro-Wrestler David Otunga Uploads a YouTube Video Titled "Harvard Lawyer & Pro-Wrestler Breaks Down Raja Jackson Attack"</h4>
      <h5>Overview</h5>
      <p>At 00:00 UTC David Otunga, a professional wrestler and Harvard educated lawyer uploads a video to his YouTube channel <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3buHgu2DUoo?si=D32gppGxm69DtpNH" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a> titled "Harvard Lawyer & Pro-Wrestler Breaks Down Raja Jackson Attack. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3buHgu2DUoo" class="source-ref" target="_blank">[x]</a></p>
      <div style="width:100%;">

      </div>
      <h5>David Provides a Potential Rationale for why Stuart may believe that Raja is part of the Show</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "(David plays clips of Raja in the backstage area) This is significant because most of the time outsiders aren't allowed into the backstage area which is basically their locker room as you can see some guys back there getting dressed or going over their matches. So obviously cameras are not allowed back there... so to the wrestlers back there, they see an unknown guy coming back there, being led by AJ and he has a video camera following him. So just that alone could suggest to the wrestlers that this may be a work (performance) because the only time cameras are allowed backstage and in the locker room is if it's part of the show... you can see Syko Stu walk up and kind of survey the scene and he sees what's going on and he's definitely very conscious and aware of the cameras. So he stands there for a little bit and he's trying to think of a way to go into business for himself, as they say, and try to earn some screen time in whatever is going on with the camera. But that quickly backfires on him."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>David's Comments on Stuart hitting Raja with a Can</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "Now it looked like this was a working strike, because he even put his left hand up... Raja says later it didn't really hurt him. So this looked like a safe strike or at least it was supposed to be. "</p>
      </div>
      <h5>David Comments on the Agreement that Raja becomes Part of the Performance & Consent</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "They have told Raja, they're giving him permission to go in and do this. And Stu is made aware of it. They even shake hands. So right there, it's implied consent. And this is a major word in this "consent"... objectively, Stu has given Raja consent for a physical altercation. They did not specify what yet, but some type of physical altercation... I don't ever see in the video where Raja is given a contract or a waiver of some sort to sign... I don't know that he didn't (sign a waiver), but it's not on this kick stream."</p>
      </div>  
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "When Raja enters that ring, he has Syko Stu's consent. Cause as professional wrestlers, we are giving consent to our opponent or whoever's in the ring with us where we're actually giving our body to them... Once Syko Stu's head hit the mat, he was unconscious. Not only did his consciousness end, but that also means, his consent ended. Somebody who's unconscious can no longer give consent. And what Rajah did was clearly outside of the scope of consent, outside of the scope of employment. I mean, this was heinous. You've seen it. It's just disgusting. It's deplorable."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>David Comments on Andre Mana's Involvement & Potential Civil Case</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "(David plays a clip of Raja and Andre Mana talking together after Stuart hit Raja with a can) Now that scene was one of the most important scenes in any potential case. Definitely a potential civil case... AJ Mana tells Raja that he gets to get his receipt or cash in on his receipt. Now a receipt in wrestling vernacular. That's the word for when, say you're working with a guy and he hits you with a stiff shot. A stiff shot means it's a hard shot. Not a safe shot, but something that they accidentally hit you too hard. Then you get to get a receipt on that person. So that means you get to give them a stiff shot back. Now, whatever you do back to them should be commensurate with what they did to you. And to be perfectly honest with you, you don't even need to cash in your receipts all the time."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "AJ didn't really thoroughly explain this to Raja. In fact, he says "you remember what a receipt is?". So he's referring to allegedly another conversation they had about this where AJ explained to him what a receipt is. However, he then tells him to tag that MF'er (motherfucker)... So it sounds like he's telling him or even encouraging Raja to really hit him or at least to lay it in and make it a very stiff shot at the least. "</p>
      </div>
      <h5>David comments on Raja speaking with his Live Chat</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "(David plays clips of Raja Speaking with his Live Chat) Wow. Now those statements right there were basically the definition of self-incrimination. Raja shares his mind state in that he's well aware that what's going on in the ring is scripted and that he intends to go off script and really f (fuck) up this professional wrestler. And then he says that he's always wanted to really f (fuck) up a professional wrestler, which is just disgusting to me."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "That clip was significant because it shows that Raja's under the impression that he's allowed or he was given permission to go into the ring and actually strike Syko Stu. When so far, they gave him permission to go in and do a spot to get his receipt. So it's limited in scope, but have they clearly defined that scope yet? Doesn't seem like they have. Because as you'll see coming up here, Raja doesn't even know when his spot is. He doesn't even know when he's gonna get his cue to go into the match. He doesn't even know when the match is coming up... Raja had to actually go seek somebody out to find out when his cue is. What match he's in? and how is he gonna know when to go to the ring?"</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "This is the closest thing there is to a smoking gun... Raja shows that he has the mens rea for criminal culpability (intent or knowledge of wrongdoing at the time an act was committed)... It just makes my stomach turn. It irritates me so much that shows that this was premeditated. You know, he even repeats to chat what his instructions were to get in there. They'll pull him off, get out. And he decided intentionally to go off script and not do that, and to go in there, and really cause serious bodily harm and damage, that could have been worse, hhe not been stopped."</p>
      </div> 
      <h5>David Claims that Stuart helps Raja Pick him Up</h5> 
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "Syko Stu actually posts, you can see, he's helping Rajah pick him up. So he's allowing Raja to do this to him. And when you're in a match, when somebody punches you, when they swing at you, you don't block it, you're allowing them to hit you in the face... So when Raja takes advantage of this, somebody who's defenceless, allowing you to beat them up. That's just despicable. This is honestly one of the worst things I've ever seen."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>David Discusses Raja's Potential Criminal Charges</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "I don't think attempted murder is likely. I think that would be incredibly hard to prove that he had the intent to kill. I think this is clearly a battery with serious bodily harm, which can be a felony. But another thing that's interesting is I actually think this is aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Let's not forget Raja is an MMA fighter. And if you're an MMA fighter, that requires you to have a license, just like a boxer where your hands and feet are considered deadly weapons. "</p>
      </div>
      <h5>David Discusses Potential Civil Charges</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "Now on to the civil liabilities. There's a litany of them. There's so many torts here, not just, you know, personally for Raja, but it gets into the promotion and anybody involved. There also could be some criminal culpability for an accessory to the people who encouraged him."</p>

        <p><span class="speaker">Quinton:</span> "This has gone too far, I’m sick of being quiet and letting all the low IQ people fall for clickbait! Yes my son took things too far, and I’m pissed at him for being a POS and the way he handled it! But if psycho Stu wasn’t drunk and wouldn’t have hit my son over the head with a (real beer can) while he was live streaming on his own stream then Knox wouldn’t have felt like they had to make things right by letting Raja get his “get back” in the ring! If my son would’ve just went to the police when the beer can incident happened then the whole event could’ve gotten shut down and he could’ve sued! But no my son is not as smart as I’d liked for him to be! Now my family and i are getting racist threats because of all the misinformation being posted so content creators can get paid from viewers! People actually think my son just snuck in a ring in front of a live audience and picked psycho Stu up without permission to be there! Get smart people! It was staged! But Raja took it too far! He only shook his hand and accepted psycho Stu’s drunken apology because they said he could get in the storyline! He was told he could “fuck him up” I have witnesses that says this isn’t the 1st time that psycho Stu had done some drunk shit backstage to a fan! Now we have the back story that my son attacked an innocent military vet with PTSD like my son knew everything about the man that came up from behind him and hit him then asked him to sell it! I have other kids to protect, and i don’t take kindly to threats! I’m not scared of prison, or dying for my kids! And calling me names won’t hurt my feelings! My son should face the consequences for going too far, he knows better! That’s why he didn’t tell me anything about the storyline. But psycho Stu is lucky i wasn’t there when he hit my son over the head with a beer can the day after he got a concussion from sparring the day before! I wouldn’t have cared if a bunch of pro wrestlers would’ve jumped me.. I’m a father 1st. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Let’s all learn a lesson, keep your damn hands to yourself. If you get paid to do fake fighting don’t disrespect people that do the shit for real! Now i put myself in this shit! Dm me now!"</p>

      <p>Douglas: "AJ (Andre Mana) is an idiot... Andre used to work at a ranch, you know, with Stu, the D6 ranch... AJ needed a place to stay and the rent was cheap over there and they said you could stay here as long as you do stable choice, which is typical for ranch work"</p>
      <h5>Douglas then accuses Andre of faux-macho chauvinism </h5>
      <p>Douglas: "Everyone who followed AJ was subject to the cringiest videos about a hard days work, a man needs meat after ranch work. He changed his oil for the first time in his life. And then he was like, every man should change their own oil. Like he thought he was the Marlboro man. He worked at a ranch and that's why he had the cowboy hat and thought he was a cowboy all of a sudden. He never done shit for himself.</p>
      <h5>Douglas explains that Stuart originally scouted Andre</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "(Andre) shows up to one of our promoter shows with Stu and Stu was like, I'm gonna give the kid a shot. I'm gonna look out for him and try to show him the ropes and teach us some things about hard work, you know, accountability, you know, integrity, you know, man stuff, you know."</p>
      <h5>Douglas explains Andre and Stuart drama backstory.</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "AJ takes it upon himself to say that he's being taken advantage of, that they're taking advantage of, they're picking on him or this or that. He's complaining about doing all the chores that he agreed to do to live there. And then lo and behold, he's not allowed to be at the ranch anymore."</p>
      <p>Douglas: "AJ's walking around the domain, multiple different days, talking about how he had heat with Stu and this and that. And he's told a couple people this, that's all been verified... And then the day happens where he brings Raja."</p>
      <h5>Douglas discusses how he would react if someone hit him on the head with a can.</h5>
      <p>"Stu did what he did. I told you, I don't agree. If you hit a beer can on my head, I will fight you instantly. It will, I will, the fade will be free and violent."</p>
      <h5>Douglas discusses how Andre Mana should have dealt with the situation.</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "And if you're AJ and you said, you're, Raja's in your hands now, you need to talk him down off the ledge and say, Hey, like, this is how this works. If you're going to do your get back, it's going to be like, Oh, a slam, like let's talk with Stu, let's, you know, figure this out, you know, let's do a piece of business together. Right. But none of that happened. Everything amplified. And that's also why I'm upset. It never should have happened.</p>
      <h5>Douglas claims that Andre lied about Rikishi being his uncle</h5>
      <p>Douglas: "He even told me when I first met you that Rikishi is your uncle. And that is not true."</p>

      <p>Douglas: "Elias (Elias Lopez), the young 17 (18) year old who was the first one to make contact with Raja is 17... He's a brave young man who had the balls to do something he was absolutely terrified of, but still went and did it anyways and he tried... You know, at that age, he did the best that he could and I'm glad that nothing bad happened to him."</p>

      <h4>The "Scaling Up Podcast" interviews Elias Lopez "Doomsday"</h4>
      <p>At 19:17 UTC professional Wrestler Elias Lopez "Doomsday" makes an appearance on the "Scaling Up Podcast" on a platform called Youtube. The hosts of this podcast are Eric Kanevsky and Tanner (Unknown Last Name). The video is 31 minutes and 57 seconds long.</p>
      <div style="width:100%;">
        <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VemPzZ3qPf0?si=YwM1dmFe3VlXU69-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen style="border-radius:12px;box-shadow:0 2px 12px rgba(13,71,161,0.10);"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p>Here are some key moments from the interview:</p>
      <p>Elias claims that he was only told about Raja's involvement during match 1, when his match was match 4. That every wrestler in the match was against the idea of Raja being in the match. That Raja was only supposed to come up to his manager, distract the ref and give Stu a single punch in the face.</p>
      <p>Erik questions Elias on Timmy pinning Stuart after the assault on Stuart had concluded. Elias states that Timmy was trying to "snap the ref back the reality" and that he shielded Stuart's body as well as rolling him to the side of the ring to prevent Stuart from choking on his own blood. Elias states that he was struggling to restrain Raja as he had injured his arm earlier in the professional wrestling match.</p>
      <p>Elias retells a story on of 2 seperate training incidents with KnokXPro Entertainment & Academy, when he was 16 years old. The first of which he got a minor concussion after failing a bump (a fall) from a clothes line (professional wrestling move). The doctor told him to take take 1-2 weeks rest, upon his return to training, he hit his head again after being DDT'd (professional wrestling move) which caused him to have a brain bleed and 2 seizures. During this discussion, Erik (former professional wrestler at KnoksXPro Entertainment & Academy) and Elias both agreed that the ring is too hard and that they should've replaced it a long time ago, Erik states that it is the same ring as they had 11 years ago. Elias states the mentality is that "if you can do it on this mat, you can do it anywhere". Erik confirms this sentiment by stating he was told by an old school wrestler there that said they used to train on concrete.</p>
      <p>Erik then retells a story of an incident that happened in a practice match at KnokXPro Entertainment & Academy, he states he wasn't taught a technique to mitigate damage when someone jumps on you, someone jumped on him with their knees into his spleen, his injury was a ruptured spleen causing internal bleeding, he almost died because of this. He recalls that his mum told the trainers about his near death experience and coach says that Erik needs to work on his selling (making hits seem believable). Erik states he was told by doctors to avoid wrestling training for 1 year, 4 months into his recovery, he heard news that a wrestler died at KnokXPro Entertainment & Academy but doesn't have any details of the death, the death may not have been wrestling related. Erik states that during this wrestlers funeral, some of the trainers were taking selfies smiling whilst holding his casket and posting them and shortly after posted videos moving of general professional wrestling promotion. After seeing this, Erik left the organisation.</p>
      <p>Erik: "Both of our situations could've been prevented with better training."</p>
      <p>Elias claims that he has spoken to Stuart and his family wouldn't divuldge any further information for privacy reasons.</p>

      <h5>David questions what took the police so long to arrest Raja</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "After 26 days, Raja Jackson has finally been arrested. Wow, 26 days? My question is, what took law enforcement so long to finally arrest Raja? I can only imagine they were caught up over the wrestling definitions, trying to figure out what's a work versus what's a shoot, what was planned, what wasn't, what went too far. Did Raja actually have permission or did he not? Did he know what he was doing? Did he intentionally go too far? All of those things. "</p>
      </div>
      <h5>David States that his Previous Prediction that Raja would not be Charged with Attempted Murder was Correct</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "Now, I know this attack is heinous and it's terrible to look at, and you might think right off it's attempted murder. However, it's not, and I made an entire video explaining why this attack doesn't meet the elements of attempted murder... I don't want to say I told you so... but either way, the charge was not attempted murder."</p>
      </div> 
      <h5>David lists Raja's Charges</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "Raja Jackson has been charged with battery causing serious bodily injury, a felony."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>David lists the criteria for the offence of Battery causing Serious Bodily Harm in California</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "All right. So what are the elements that need to be established in order to prove battery causing serious bodily injury? …Any willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon another person. Now, in this situation, do we have that satisfied? Yes, absolutely. We definitely have a willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon another person. This is with the beat down on Syko Stu. When Raja was raining over 20 punches down on an unconscious Syko Stu. So we have that very public, very viral, violent attack. So that is satisfied. So next, there needs to be serious bodily injury a significant or substantial injury, broken bones, loss of consciousness, ding, ding, ding. We have it right there. Also severe disfigurement, concussion, etc. Now, we know from the video, Syko Stu lost consciousness from the slam that Raja gave him."</p>
      </div>
      <h5>David highlights the penalties for Battery causing Serious Bodily Harm in California</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "All right. So let's go down to the penalties. Now, battery causing serious bodily injury is known as a wobbler offense in California, meaning it can be charged as either a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the severity of the case and the defendant's record. And if it's a misdemeanor, you could be charged or you can receive up to one year in county jail, up to $1,000 fine. But we know in this case, Raja is charged with a felony. So he'll be facing two, three or four years in state prison with up to a $10,000 fine. So there you have it. If Raja Jackson were to be convicted of battery causing serious bodily injury, he could face up to a maximum of four years in prison and or a $10,000 fine."</p>
      </div> 
      <h5>David states Raja's defence would not be able to claim that it's acting after Stuart becomes unconscious</h5>
      <div class="quote-block quote-blue">
        <p><span class="speaker">David:</span> "Now, Syko Stu lost consciousness before Raja rained down over 20 punches on him. And despite whatever defense Raja may try to make, when Syko Stu lost consciousness, he was no longer consenting to anything pro wrestling wise, or whatever Raja was doing, or may have construed as pro wrestling, his consent went out the window and ended the moment his consciousness did."</p>
